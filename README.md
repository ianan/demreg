# demreg
Calculate the Differential Emission Measure (DEM) from solar data using regularised inversion in SSWIDL.

Note that this is a work in progress version of the previous code mapping DEM Reg code http://www.astro.gla.ac.uk/~iain/demreg/map/

The improvements over the older code is that it can deal with data other than just SDO/AIA and in a variety of forms (single pixel or arrays of pixels). There are also a number of bug fixes to avoid the output of NANs etc.
